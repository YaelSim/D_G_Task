# D_G_Task
The project was written using React and Node.js.
The game starts in the "Welcome page" where the first player press the "create new game" button and gets a room number. The second player will join to the existing room with the same room number, and then the game will start.
The first player will get 3 random words that he can choose to draw (Easy: 3-4 letters – 1 point, Medium: 5 letters – 3 points, Hard: 6 letters – 5 points) and then he will draw the word on the canvas and send it to the second player. 
The second player will get the drawing and will see it as video of the incoming drawing, and will guess the word. After submitting the answer, it will be the second's pleyer turn to choose and draw the word. There is an option to exit the game in every page and return to the "Welcome page".
My project include 5 views: Welcome view, Waiting view , Word choosing view, Drawing view and Guessing view.
